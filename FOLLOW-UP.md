1- npm i moment
npm install moment-duration-format,
Used the Library to format Time duration eg duration :145 to 1h 45

2. npm i react-icons
   Used for icons like the Arrow icon used in the site

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

The command is the default ‘npm start’ but you would want to do a ‘npm install’ to install node modules in the project directory.

‘npm install’ first
(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

1. I did Like to improve the quality of code.
2. Implement unit Test cases to accomplish the Task(Test Driven Development).
3. Add modules that can connect the Site to a Rest-API to make real- time and Dynamic query.
4. I did like to rework the Json file from the backend API that serves the data. Break it up and Assign some reference for Primary/foreign key to make the query in the frontend lots simpler handle.
5. Serve the site via NGINX and implement a load balance for the site.
6. Package the Site into a Docker Image for easy deployment, continues development and integration.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I did like the fact that I was able to accomplish the task knowing that the solution could be better and be made efficient than it is. It's a knowledge and experience addition.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spend the most time trying to understand the Backpack library and why there seems to be a conflict with Materialized UI and react-script library.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

The test was an opportunity to learn new procedures, engineering approach to development and exposure to likely trending concepts and design. On the overall it's an addition to building my skills.

The test was requested unfortunately when i was neck- deep handling an assignment.
